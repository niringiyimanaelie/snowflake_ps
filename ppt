# **Slide 1 – Title**

**Document AI to AI_EXTRACT Transition**
**PenFed Credit Union | Snowflake Platform Update**

Presenter: *Your Name*
Role: Senior Data Scientist / Architect
Date: *Date*

---

# **Slide 2 – Context**

* PenFed uses Snowflake as the primary analytics and data platform
* Document processing is a core capability across multiple workflows
* Snowflake is evolving its document AI platform
* This session provides awareness and technical direction

---

# **Slide 3 – What Is Happening**

* Snowflake is **deprecating the Document AI Model Build UI**
* Customers are encouraged to use **AI_EXTRACT** for new document extraction use cases
* AI_EXTRACT is powered by **arctic-extract**
* Customer announcement date: **November 26, 2025**
* Deprecation date: **February 28, 2026**

---

# **Slide 4 – Business Continuity**

* All existing **published and trained Document AI models** continue to run
* Models stored in the **Snowflake Model Registry** remain supported
* No immediate disruption to production workloads
* Migration can be planned and executed incrementally

---

# **Slide 5 – Why This Change (The Model)**

AI_EXTRACT is powered by Snowflake’s **best-in-class extraction model: arctic-extract**

* Higher accuracy and faster inference performance
* Expanded multilingual document support
* Vision-based modeling for full document context
* Feature parity: entities, lists, tables, checkboxes, multi-page extraction
* Longer output token limits for tabular extraction
* Single inference call for entity, list, and table extraction
* Continued investment in new model versions

---

# **Slide 6 – Why This Change (New Capabilities)**

AI_EXTRACT enables **programmatic access** for document extraction

* SQL and Python APIs are **Generally Available**
* Seamless integration into existing workflows and automation pipelines
* Supports dynamic and multi-format documents (invoices, contracts, forms)
* Enables **conditional extraction**
* **Zero-copy inference** by referencing files in Snowflake or external stages
* Supports **cross-region inference**

---

# **Slide 7 – Document AI (Previous Architecture)**

* UI-driven **Model Build** experience
* Documents, prompts, and annotations managed in the UI
* Models published and stored in the **Model Registry**
* Inference executed via Document AI APIs
* Lifecycle separate from core Snowflake data pipelines

---

# **Slide 8 – AI_EXTRACT (New Architecture)**

* Documents stored in Snowflake or external stages
* AI_EXTRACT executed directly via SQL or Python
* No dependency on a UI for production workflows
* Results written directly to Snowflake tables
* Unified security, governance, and monitoring

---

# **Slide 9 – What Happens to Existing Document AI Model Builds**

* After **February 2026**, Document AI UI (Model Builds) will not be available
* Customers can **export**:

  * Files
  * Prompts
  * Annotations
* Exported assets can be used to run **AI_EXTRACT**
* Published models saved in the **Model Registry** continue to run
* One-time migration required for models not in the registry

---

# **Slide 10 – API and Billing Changes**

* Inference API changes:

  * `DocAIModel.predict(file)`
  * → `AI_EXTRACT(DocAIModel.file)`
* New API returns a different response format
* Inference scripts must be updated accordingly
* Billing changes:

  * From **GPU per hour**
  * To **credits per million tokens**
* Expanded **in-region availability** for inference

---

# **Slide 11 – Features Available Going Forward**

* **AI_EXTRACT** – Generally Available
* **Model Build Export** – Generally Available
* **Cortex Fine-Tuning API** – In Preview
* **Document Processing Playground** – For business and technical users

---

# **Slide 12 – Document Processing Playground (Pupr)**

* Low-code / no-code document extraction evaluation
* Designed for **technical and business users**
* Natural language prompts without SQL or JSON upfront
* Quickly test Snowflake AISQL document processing
* Automatically generates production-ready code

---

# **Slide 13 – Arctic-Extract Fine-Tuning API (Preview)**

* Programmatic end-to-end fine-tuning and deployment
* Integrates with existing data ingestion and labeling workflows
* Supports continuous model improvement and reduced drift
* **Zero-copy fine-tuning** using Snowflake or external stages
* Model Registry used for versioning and lineage
* Currently available in **limited regions**

---

# **Slide 14 – Summary**

* Snowflake is transitioning from UI-based Document AI to **AI_EXTRACT**
* Existing models remain supported for business continuity
* AI_EXTRACT aligns better with production data pipelines
* Simplified architecture and improved governance
* Recommended approach for all **new** document extraction use cases

---

# **Slide 15 – Q&A**
